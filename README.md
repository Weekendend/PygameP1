# Parsa Pygame Project 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) create a pygame program
2) ask the user to enter a color (give the user 3 or four options)
3) ask the user to choose between printing a rectangle or circle
4) print out what the user chose to the middle of the screen
        ex: chose red and circle, then print out a red circle

make sure your code is readable and documented with understandable comments
